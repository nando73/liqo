## Install 


## Peer with another cluster

In order to peer with another cluster, you need to have **two** Kubernetes clusters with Liqo enabled.
Therefore you may need to repeat the above procedure on another cluster in order to get a second Liqo instance.

Once you have two clusters ready, you can start the peering procedure, which is presented in the [next step](../peer).
