While the [installation procedure](../gettingstarted) works in most cases, you may need to configure some additional parameters or tune your setup.

This section presents some additional configuration options for your Liqo cluster:

* [Reference](./cluster-config): how to set the desired configuration for your cluster (e.g. how many resources to share, the policies to accept another cluster etc...)
* [Scheduling](./scheduling): how to force the Kubernetes scheduler to start pods the way we like
* [Authentication](./authentication): how to set up the inter-cluster authentication
